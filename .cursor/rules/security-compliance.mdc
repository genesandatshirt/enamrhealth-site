# Security & Compliance Baselines

## Data handling
- Do not log or store plaintext PII in client-side code.
- Store emails only via approved providers (e.g., Mailchimp/ConvertKit) or secure server-side storage.
- Use HTTPS-only endpoints and avoid exposing secrets in client bundles.

## Secrets
- Store API keys in environment variables (`.env*`), never commit them.
- Keep `.env*` in `.gitignore`; use Vercel Environment Variables for production.

## Client-side best practices
- Validate input on the client and server.
- Use safe defaults for forms: `type="email"` and basic format checks.
- Provide clear error/success feedback and avoid ambiguous states.

## Dependencies
- Prefer well‑maintained libraries.
- Avoid adding packages without a clear need.
- Keep dependencies minimal for the marketing site.

## Analytics & Cookies
- Require explicit consent before setting non‑essential cookies.
- Ensure cookie banners can be dismissed and remembered.

## Accessibility
- Ensure color contrast meets WCAG 2.1 AA.
- Provide meaningful button labels and focus states.

## Deployments
- Only deploy from `main`.
- Validate after deployment: hero renders, form submits, cookie banner works.
